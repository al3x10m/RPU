WARNING: It seems that as of 2015-12-04 whoever is responsible for GW launcher.dat based bricks changed the MMC lock key. Therefore it's now impossible to unlock without a good NAND dump (at least for now, perhaps forever)!

RPU: Raspberry Pi based 3DS unbricker

This tool is erotic cartoon ware.

If you like it please send one erotic cartoon picture to rpu.bkifft.gbatemp@gmail.com (even if you draw one in paint yourself, everyone likes to draw the cock and balls).



Even though this tool already unbricked 3DSes successfully (thirty-ish that i know of and counting) use it at your own risk.


Bill of materials:

-a launcher.dat bricked 3DS with the NAND dump HW mod as described in http://gbatemp.net/threads/nand-flash-dump-3ds-xl.350668/ or http://gbatemp.net/threads/nand-flash-dump-3ds.353263/

-a Raspberry Pi

-a way to power the Pi (microUSB plug, either by using an adaptor cable or a smartphone charger)

-a SD card >= 2GB

-an USB stick >= 2GB

-mini linux image https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4Gv-RnAT-F_THRPT21NWjNWVXc (based on SpillPassPi http://www.spillmonkey.com/?page_id=5)

-ability to connect the Pi to your ethernet network (for online acces and ssh)



If you can't/won't connect the Pi to the network you also need: 

-update file from https://github.com/bkifft/RPU/archive/master.zip

-USB Keyboard

-if you've got a Pi with only one USB port an USB hub (preferably powered)

-HDMI cable and HDMI capable TV/monitor



Instructions:

1) Extract the linux image.

2) Write the image to the SD card and the USB stick (using win32diskimager for example).

3a) When you use ethernet: check the network settings in the file "interfaces" on the FAT partititon (the one shown on windows) of the USB stick and tweak it to your needs, it's preset to IP 192.168.1.244 and gateway 192.168.1.1.

3b) When you dont use ethernet: rename the update zip file you downloaded earlier to RPU.zip (capital letters do matter) and put it on the USB stick FAT partititon.

4) Plug the SD card and the USB stick into the Pi (doesn't matter which USB port if you've got 2 or use an USB hub).

5) Plug in the other stuff (ethernet or HDMI and USB keyboard) then power it up by plugging in the microUSB.

6) Wait untill it booted (about one minute), if you have hooked it up via HDMI you will see the progress on the screen.

7a) If you are using it via ethernet: ssh into it (you can use putty for that if you are on windows). 

8) Log in using root as username and password.

10) Type in 3dsunbrick and press enter. (If you are sure that you are already on the latest version you can skip the update check with 3dsunbrick NOUPDATE)

11) Wait for the tool to update itself and to load.

12) Read the text on the screen.

13) Remove the SD card.

14) Plug in the SDmod card connected to your 3DS and turn the 3DS on.

15) Press s and enter. The tool will try to connect to the 3DS and read it's status. If it shows an error message there are problems with your HW mod or you get interference. Try detaching the charger from your 3DS and powering the Pi from a filtered and stabilized power source (like powering it from an USB port using an USB/microUSB cable). 

16) If it reports the MMC to be locked (in other words: it was able to connect to the 3DS and your brick is launcher.dat related) press u and enter.

17) Unless the tool reported an error you should now have an unbricked 3DS.

18) Don't forget to send an erotic cartoon picture to rpu.bkifft.gbatemp@gmail.com and enjoy your unbricked 3DS.
