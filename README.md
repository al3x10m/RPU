Raspberry Pi based 3DS unbricker


This tool is erotic cartoon ware.

If you like it please send one erotic cartoon picture to rpu.bkifft.gbatemp@gmail.com (even if you draw one in paint yourself, everyone likes to draw the cock and balls).

WARNING: Do not run this tool with a kernel that has the MMC/SD subsystem enabled!
(The supplied linux image has those drivers disabled. Also the tool should refuse to run if those drivers are loaded.)



This tool can be used to unbrick a launcher.dat bricked 3DS.

WARNING: It seems that as of 2015-12-04 whoever is responsible for GW launcher.dat based bricks changed the MMC lock key. Therefore it's now impossible to unlock without a good NAND dump (at least for now, perhaps forever)!

Check RPU_guide.txt for requirements and instructions.
